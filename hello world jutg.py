"""
Write a program that prints a line with the message “Hello world!”.

Input

There is not input: the program does not read anything.

Output

Print exactly the required text in a line.

Observation

This problem is atypical, because we do not need to read any input, and we always have to print the same.
It is very easy!

a = input()
print ("Hello world!")
